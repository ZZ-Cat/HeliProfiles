# Contributing to Heli Profiles

Thank you for helping to make Heli Profiles better.
Before you can go Gung Ho on coding, there are a few house rules I need you to familiarise yourself with.

## Do's & don'ts

### **Do...**

1. Read the README in its entirety _before_ submitting an issue, as your "bug" may very well be a case of PICNIC.
2. Keep your issues relevant.
3. Respond in a timely manner.
4. If something isn't working, please provide evidence (EG Screenshots).
5. Provide as much detail as is absolutely necessary & _keep it concise._
6. Make use of issue templates - Especially if it's your first time submitting an issue to someone's repository on GitHub.
7. Use the Discussions tab for things are not Issues or Pull Requests, but are still relevant to the Heli Profiles.

### **Don't...**

1. Use Heli Profiles on incompatible hardware & write me an issue about "strange behaviour".
2. Ghost me for more than 14 consecutive days.
3. Write things like "This isn't working" & refuse to provide any information &/or context beyond that.
4. Write walls of text. Do this & watch how quickly I mark your issue as "TL;DR" & close it without any response from me.
5. Beg for updates. Please don't do this. If you do, I will intentionally take longer to release said update to spite you.
6. Assume that the project is "dead" after any significant amount of time has passed.

To emphasise Rule 6 - `Don't assume the project is "dead" after any significant amount of time has passed.`
I _cannot_ stress this enough to you. I am only one person, & there is only a finite amount of time that I can allocate to each of my projects. If one of my projects is "dead", I will have already said so. Simply because it has been a long time since I last updated any one of my projects, that does not mean that the project has been discontinued.

When I choose to discontinue a project, I don't do it silently.
I _clearly_ state why I am discontinuing a project & I provide notice (from the first day of the next available calendar month) stating that the project will be discontinued after 30 calendar days.
Then, the project will become "Read Only", & it will have a prominent notice stating that the project is discontinued & why it was discontinued.

After about a year of the project being marked as "Read Only", I may elect to archive it, delete it, or reinstate it, depending on the circumstances of the project at the time.

## A few notable points

- Heli Profiles requires _all_ commits to be properly signed/verfied. Pull Requests that have unverified commits will not be accepted.
- Not every Pull Request can/will be accepted. Simply because you submitted it, that doesn't automatically guarantee that your Pull Request will be merged.
- With the above rule being said... I reserve the right to decline any Pull Request if I deem it necessary to do so. I also reserve the right to decline a Pull Request with or without providing a reason to do so (even though I prefer to tell you why it was declined).
- All Pull Requests to the Main-Trunk must be reviewed before they can be merged. If I suggest to you to make changes to your Pull Request, don't fight me on it. I already have a reason why those changes need to be made (& I already would have told you what that reason is).
